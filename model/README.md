### The five fingers of four bitty

All the a-holes who want to solve AI cannot get their heads around _The Turing Conundrum_, which, in as few words means that all computation is an illusion. More accurately, a _simulation_ of process and control. According to a 2024 mockumentary that was so dull one has to turn it off after twelve minutes, heads pontificate about something _in between_ zero and one. This was already disclosed in 1952 by Korn and Korn but who cares about a robust literature survey? Since this bodes so well, here is a table of numbers.

| binary | quinary | binary | quinary |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| 0      | 0       | 1000   | 13      |
| 1      | 1       | 1001   | 14      |
| 10     | 2       | 1010   | 20      |
| 11     | 3       | 1011   | 21      |
| 100    | 4       | 1100   | 22      |
| 101    | 10      | 1101   | 23      |
| 110    | 11      | 1110   | 24      |
| 111    | 12      | 1111   | 30      |

Go and smoke that and see where the high takes you.
